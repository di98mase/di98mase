- 👋 Hi, I’m @di98mase and I am Swedish.
- 👀 my daughter is a figure skater and I am former embedded developer who never learned about window programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about QT and I would like to code with someone who can support my project and also support my work and teach me more about code guidelines etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a software for planning and executing a figure skating competition. 
- 📫
